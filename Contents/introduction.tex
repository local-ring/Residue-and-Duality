The main purpose of these is to prove a duality theorem for the cohomology of quasi-coherent sheaves, with respect to a proper morphism of locally noetherian preschemes. Various such theorems are already known. Typical is the duality theorem for a non-singular complete curve $X$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, which say that
\[h^0(D)=h^1(K-D),\]
where $D$ is a divisor, $K$ is the canonical divisor, and 
\[h^{i}(D)=\dim_k H^i(X,L(D))\]
for any $i$, and any divisor $D$. (See e.g. \cite{s1959} Ch. II for a proof.) \par

Various attempts were made to generalize this theorem to varieties of higher dimension, and as Zariski points out in his report \cite{report1956}, his generalization of a lemma of Enriques-Severi \cite{z1952}.
