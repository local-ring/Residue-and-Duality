% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references

Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Furtheron please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations.

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

Use the standard \verb|equation| environment to typeset your equations, e.g.
%
\begin{equation}
a \times b = c\;,
\end{equation}
%
however, for multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray|
environment\footnote{In physics texts please activate the class option \texttt{vecphys} to depict your vectors in \textbf{\itshape boldface-italic} type - as is customary for a wide range of physical subjects.}.
\begin{eqnarray}
a \times b = c \nonumber\\
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}=\vec{c}
\label{eq:01}
\end{eqnarray}

When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.

\biblstarthook{In view of the parallel print and (chapter-wise) online publication of your book at \url{www.springerlink.com} it has been decided that -- as a genreral rule --  references should be sorted chapter-wise and placed at the end of the individual chapters. However, upon agreement with your contact at Springer you may list your references in a single seperate chapter at the end of your book. Deactivate the class option \texttt{sectrefs} and the \texttt{thebibliography} environment will be put out as a chapter of its own.\\\indent
References may be \textit{cited} in the text either by number (preferred) or by author/year.\footnote{Make sure that all references from the list are cited in the text. Those not cited should be moved to a separate \textit{Further Reading} section or chapter.} The reference list should ideally be \textit{sorted} in alphabetical order -- even if reference numbers are used for the their citation in the text. If there are several works by the same author, the following order should be used: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item all works by the author alone, ordered chronologically by year of publication
\item all works by the author with a coauthor, ordered alphabetically by coauthor
\item all works by the author with several coauthors, ordered chronologically by year of publication.
\end{enumerate}
The \textit{styling} of references\footnote{Always use the standard abbreviation of a journal's name according to the ISSN \textit{List of Title Word Abbreviations}, see \url{http://www.issn.org/en/node/344}} depends on the subject of your book:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{two} recommended styles for references in books on \textit{mathematical, physical, statistical and computer sciences} are depicted in ~\cite{science-contrib, science-online, science-mono, science-journal, science-DOI} and ~\cite{phys-online, phys-mono, phys-journal, phys-DOI, phys-contrib}.
\item Examples of the most commonly used reference style in books on \textit{Psychology, Social Sciences} are~\cite{psysoc-mono, psysoc-online,psysoc-journal, psysoc-contrib, psysoc-DOI}.
\item Examples for references in books on \textit{Humanities, Linguistics, Philosophy} are~\cite{humlinphil-journal, humlinphil-contrib, humlinphil-mono, humlinphil-online, humlinphil-DOI}.
\item Examples of the basic Springer style used in publications on a wide range of subjects such as \textit{Computer Science, Economics, Engineering, Geosciences, Life Sciences, Medicine, Biomedicine} are ~\cite{basic-contrib, basic-online, basic-journal, basic-DOI, basic-mono}.
